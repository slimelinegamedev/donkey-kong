Our favourite game is here.. Donkey Kong
 
The goal is simple. You have to rescue the princess and the level gets higher.
Obviously, the game doesn't have infinite levels due to the time constraint.

PRE REQUISITIES:
1. You need to install python2.7 and pygame in your machine.

2. First level is simple. You just have to reach the princess and collect coins as much as you can while escaping through the fireballs thrown by the donkey at random times. Fireballs can decrease player's life by one and decrease the points by 25. Each coin values +5 and on completing a level, you get +50.

3. Second Level is a bit trickier with two donkeys both firing fireballs at you and that too randomly. You must manage to get through this to go to the next levels which is same as the second one.

A - MOVE LEFT
D - MOVE RIGHT
W - MOVE UP ON STAIRS
S - MOVE DOWN ON STAIRS
SPACE - JUMP
Q - QUIT
